## Data Analysis using Pandas and Plotly on a Jupyter notebook

- Dataset from Google Play Store
- The dataset used was compiled around 2017/2018
- The dataset does not represent every single app in the Google Play Store during this period
- The dataset was served up based on the geographical location (USA) and user behaviour of the user who scraped it
- Each apps datasize has been converted to a float in MB, if a value for this field was missing then it has been replaced by the average size for that category
'Installs' does not represent an exact number of user installs, e.g. if an app has 123,456 installs, Google simply reports an order of magnitude such as 100,000+ (The + has been removed)
